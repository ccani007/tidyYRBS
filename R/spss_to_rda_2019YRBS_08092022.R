######  Opening raw SPSS data set  ###########################################
# To get the YRBS 2019 data set into R I first downloaded the .sav document
# from the CDC and the SPSS syntax. I modified the file extension to match 
# where the saved raw data was in my computer. Once I had the data set in .sav 
# I imported it into R, and saved it as an RDS to reduce the size of the file.
