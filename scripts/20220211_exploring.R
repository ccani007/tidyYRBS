# To get the high school data set into R I first downloaded the .sav document 
# from the CDC and the SPSS syntax. I modified line 318 from the syntax because 
# it exceed the number of characters allowed and it generated an error opening 
# the data in SPSS. Once I had the data set in .sav I imported it into R, and 
# saved it as an RDS to reduce the size of the file.

# This code tells R the design elements in the survey (PSU, Weights, Strata)
## It should be used for analysis because ignoring the PSUs will tend to yield 
## standard errors that are too small, leading to false positives when doing 
## significance tests (https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/seminars/survey-data-analysis-with-r/).

# I converted question 28 to a numeric variable assuming the worst case scenario
## Therefore, if a participant selected 3, that means 2 to 3 attempts, the value
## is interpreted as 3, if he selected 4 that means 4 to 5 times the value will 
## be 5. For question 29, I converted it into a binary variable, so when a participant
## selects option 1 that is "I did not attempt suicide during the past 12 months"
## then I do not care about that answer and set it to be an NA, then I assign a value
## of 1 if thet attempted suicide and 0 if they did not.
