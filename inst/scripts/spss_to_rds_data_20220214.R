###  Opening raw SPSS data sets  ###
# To get the high school data set into R I first downloaded the .sav document 
# from the CDC and the SPSS syntax. I modified line 318 from the syntax because 
# it exceed the number of characters allowed and it generated an error opening 
# the data in SPSS. Once I had the data set in .sav I imported it into R, and 
# saved it as an RDS to reduce the size of the file.
