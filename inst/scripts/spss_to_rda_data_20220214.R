######  Opening raw SPSS data sets  ###########################################
# To get the high school data set into R I first downloaded the .sav document
# from the CDC and the SPSS syntax. I modified line 318 from the syntax because
# it exceed the number of characters allowed and it generated an error opening
# the data in SPSS. Once I had the data set in .sav I imported it into R, and
# saved it as an RDS to reduce the size of the file.


###  Middle School  ###
# ms_district <- read_sav("inst/extData/sadc_ms_2019_district.sav")
# ms_state_a_m <- read_sav("inst/extData/sadc_ms_2019_state_a_m.sav")
# ms_state_n_z <- read_sav("inst/extData/sadc_ms_2019_state_n_z.sav")


###  High School  ###
hs_district_raw <- read_sav("inst/extData/sadc_hs_2019_district.sav")
# saveRDS(hs_district_raw, "data/hs_district.rds")



######  Clean Geography  ######################################################
# Cleaned the sitename vector. Separated the city from the state and the
#   abbreviation. Eliminated the word "county" and "burough of". Eliminated
#   special characters such as "(),"

hs_district <-

######  Suicide-Specific Subset  ##############################################

###  Suicidality Metrics  ###
# Generated a new data set that includes variables related to suicidality,
#   recoded binary variables from 1-2 to 0-1, renamed sex variables and
#   corrected the type of vector of the sex and record variables.
# Because we are inspecting high-school students only, grade may be more
#   informative and have fewer artefacts than age
suicidalityCols_char <- c(
	"state", "district", "year", "weight", "stratum", "PSU", "record",
	"grade", "sex", "race4", "bmipct", "sexid",
	"q26", "q27", "q28", "q29"
)


###  Re-code Factors  ###
# I converted question 28 to a numeric variable assuming the worst case scenario
#   Therefore, if a participant selected 3, that means "2 to 3 attempts", the value
#   is interpreted as 3, if he/she selected 4 that means" 4 to 5 times" the value will
#   be 5. For question 29, I converted it into a binary variable, so when a participant
#   selects option 1 that is "I did not attempt suicide during the past 12 months"
#   then I do not care about that answer and set it to be an NA, then I assign a value
#   of 1 if they attempted suicide and 0 if they did not.
