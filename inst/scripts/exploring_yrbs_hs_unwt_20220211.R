###  Geography  ###
# Cleaned the sitename vector. Separated the city from the state and the
#   abbreviation. Eliminated the word "county" and "burough of". Eliminated
#   special characters such as "(),"

###  Suicidality Metrics  ###
# Generated a new data set that includes variables related to suicidality,

#   corrected the type of vector of the sex and record variables.

#### YRBS organized by city and year so that they are the experimental unit ###

# I converted question 28 to a numeric variable assuming the worst case scenario
#   Therefore, if a participant selected 3, that means "2 to 3 attempts", the value
#   is interpreted as 3, if he/she selected 4 that means" 4 to 5 times" the value will 
#   be 5. For question 29, I converted it into a binary variable, so when a participant
#   selects option 1 that is "I did not attempt suicide during the past 12 months"
#   then I do not care about that answer and set it to be an NA, then I assign a value
#   of 1 if they attempted suicide and 0 if they did not.
